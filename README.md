# Airline-Management-System
## Abstract
Airline Management System (AMS) plays a crucial role in efficiently managing various aspects of airline operations, including reservations, ticketing, scheduling, fleet management, passenger services, and financial transactions. Previously the whole thing was done manually using file systems only at some gas stations and airports, But now a days we can book tickets and to record any details regarding to airlines we uses data bases. Our project is aimed at exposing the relevance and importance of Airline Reservation Systems. With this project, we aim to demonstrate the Create, Read, Update and Delete operations using MySQL database. This project shows the effectiveness of databases as the data loss is so less in them and the main advantage of this is if anything has been rescheduled then the data is automatically updates in the database by which the information is more transparent to every one and there will no miss communication. This abstract presents an overview of an effective database management system (DBMS) implementation for an airline management system.

These systems provide real-time access to critical information, enable online reservations and ticketing, facilitate efficient scheduling and resource allocation, and support seamless communication between various stakeholders, including passengers, airline staff, and ground handling agencies.
